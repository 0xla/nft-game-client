### This is a mini turn-based NFT browser game! Feel free to check it out here : https://nft-game-client-pro.vercel.app !

## Tech Stack Used:-

    1) Next.js.
    2) Tailwind CSS for Styling.
    3) Solidity for minting NFTs and storing their metadata on chain.
    4) IPFS for storing NFT Image files.
    5) Vercel for Deployment.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
